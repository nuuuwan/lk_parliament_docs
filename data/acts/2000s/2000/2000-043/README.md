        5. Where the policy matures for payment during the lifetime of the person whose life is assured or where the nominee, or if there are more nominees than one, all the nominees, die before the policy matures for payment, the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to the policy holder or his heirs or legal representatives, as the case may be.
