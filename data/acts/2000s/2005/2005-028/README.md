He shall also indemnify the drawer against any loss incurred due to the presentment being made by electronic means instead of by presentment of the cheque itself.
            - Warranties and indemnity.
        2. A banker who issues an image return document in terms of subsection (1) of section 34 warrants that it is a true copy of the cheque to which it relates and shall also indemnify the drawer against any loss in the event of the cheque itself being paid or sued on.

        4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3), the person stated to be the  drawer of the cheque, may recover on the breach of warranty or indemnity and claim under this section directly from the banker on whom the cheque is drawn, who may then be subrogated to the claim of that person against the banker making the warranty, or be liable on the indemnity obligation.
