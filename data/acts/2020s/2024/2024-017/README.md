            c. priority between unperfected security rights shall be determined by the date of the creation of such security rights.
        2. For the purpose of subsection (1)-
            a. a continuously perfected security right shall be treated at all times as if perfected by the method by which it was originally perfected; and

        2. Except where the collateral or its proceeds is either inventory or its proceeds, an acquisition security right in collateral or its proceeds shall have priority over any other security right in the same collateral given by the same debtor, if the acquisition security right-
            a. in the case of a collateral other than an intangible collateral, was perfected before or within ten days after the debtor obtained possession of the collateral as the debtor, or a third party at the request of the debtor obtained or held possession of the collateral, whichever occurs earlier; or
            b. in the case of an intangible collateral, was perfected before or within ten days after the creation of the acquisition security right in the intangible collateral.
